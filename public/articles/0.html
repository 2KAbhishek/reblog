  <h1>New Blog</h1>
  <article class="post-container">

    I made a new blog while exploring React and Wordpress and these are my findings.

    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <li>Uses React with Webpack and genrates optimized bundles for deployment.</li>
    <li>Minimal and clean design, puts all focus on the blog content.</li>
    <li>Easy to add new articles using Wordpress.</li>
    <li>Has a completely responsive design, works everywhere.</li>

    <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
    <li>No server side rendering</li>
    <li>No support for Markdown, which would make articles easier to write</li>
    <li>External dependency on Wordpress for writing articles</li>

    <h2>Improving</h2>
    Using something like Next.js could help tackle the SSR problem, but seems too much for a blog.<br>
    Static site generators like Gatsby, Jekyll or Hugo can help solve a lot of the drawbacks.
