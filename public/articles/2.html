  <h1>Password Managers 101</h1>
  <article class="post-container">
    All of us have at least 20 (definitely more!) accounts on the internet today and managing all those passwords can
    get tricky if not done correctly.

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    You can easily forget your password and if you don’t you have a very easy to guess password, and that is a very
    terrible thing to do.<br>
    You also have to remember other information like credit card informations, licence
    keys, secure notes etc.<br><br>

    A simple solution to those problems is a password manager.<br>
    A password manager creates a database of your passwords, username and other details.<br><br>

    Those passwords could then be easily synced across your devices and with things like autofill they make the whole
    online experience much simpler to everyone without worrying about a gazillion passwords.<br>
    You do have to remember the master password for your specific database and that’s a necessary evil.

    <h2>How?</h2>
    A good option is KeePass it has both online and offline sync capabilities and is completely free.<br><br>
    <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> is available on all the major platforms including Windows, Android, Linux, macOS, iOS,
    Firefox, Chrome etc.<br>
